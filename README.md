# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The project was created for the client, DriverPass. DriverPass is a drivers education companty that helps students pass their drivers exams by offering practice tests,  quizzes, videos, and on the road drivers training with a trainer. They wanted us to create a system for their customers to be able to access all of this in one place.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I was able to create successful UML diagrams. I really enjoyed creating these as I am a very visual person and these diagrams help me to create the rest of the project.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could go back, I would work on my presentation to the client. The first time we did this, I did it incorrectly and used technical words the client would not understand. I am hoping that I did a better job with this in project 2.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I paid very close attention to the clients requirements when working through the project. This is important because if we deliver a system that does not have all of the requirements the client had requested, it could cause a lot or re-work and our company would lose a lot of time and money as well.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I always start with the visual tools, such as the UML diagrams, to lay out the entire system so that I can refer back to them in the future. After my visual tools are created, I would go back over them to verify that I didn't miss anything and then start working on the technical part of the system.
